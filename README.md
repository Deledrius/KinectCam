# KinectCam

![CI](https://github.com/Deledrius/KinectCam/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This project creates a virtual camera DirectShow filter for the Kinect v1.


Portions of this code are based on posts made by [ScottOrange on MSDN](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/kinectsdk/thread/4ee6e7ca-123d-4838-82b6-e5816bf6529c), initially developed as a small program to allow use of the Kinect Camera as a webcam.  It was subsequently organized by [wildbillcat](https://github.com/wildbillcat).
